Exercise 5: Take the following Python code that stores a string:
str 'X-DSPAM-Conf idence:0.8475
Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the colon characterand then use the float function to convert the extracted string into a floating point number

str = 'X-DSPAM_Confidence:0.10050805'

index_before_num = str.find(':')

number = float(str[index_before_num+1:])

print(number)
